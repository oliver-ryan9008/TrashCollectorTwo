# TrashCollectorTwo

This was a project I completed while at devCodeCamp in Milwaukee, WI. It is a web app built to emulate a website for a trash collection company. The site was built using ASP.NET MVC 5, Bootstrap, C#, JavaScript, HTML5, and jQuery. 

The project was a 5 day solo project with the ability for customers to sign up to receive and schedule pickups, see their bill for the services, and customize pickup options. 

The employees subsequently are able to view any customers who have pickups in the employees zip code for the current day or another day of the week, as well as confirm pickups (and charging customers) that have been completed. Employees are also able to see a map with their location compared to customers' addresses to best plan their routes for the day.

Thank you for checking out the project. Please feel free to ask any questions you may have and/or point out any bugs found! As time allows, I am continuing to add/update functionality. I look forward to hearing any feedback!
